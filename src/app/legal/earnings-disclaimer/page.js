                While we strive to educate and inspire individuals about
                utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) content to create
                websites and generate income, it is essential to recognize that

                including its officers, directors, employees, and affiliates,
                are aspirational statements regarding potential earnings.

                Earnings and income results depend on various factors, many of
                which are unique to each individual.
                <br />
                <br />
                We cannot predict how well you will perform, as we lack
                knowledge of your background, work ethic, dedication,
                motivation, desire, and business skills or practices. Hence, we
                do not guarantee or imply that you will become wealthy, achieve
                similar success, or have any earnings at all.

                <br />
                Engaging in internet businesses and deriving income from them
                involve inherent risks and may not be suitable for everyone.
